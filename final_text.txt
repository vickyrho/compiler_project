e Teseract is used to train a model to recognise PDF input
and convert the PDF content into textual data

e Tesseract is fast and easy to train any type of input (i.e.)
text, plain text ,pdf or image input

e Tesseract can be trained to recognise over a 100
languages and various fonts as well as hand written text ,
so it can be easily scaled to other applicationsPOS tagging

«_ POS (PART OF SPEECH) tagging is done using NLTK
where the output spit out form tesseract is fed as input

e The pos tagger constructs a parse tree and the relevant
and irrelevant elements can be ignored this makes the
topic modelling easierTopic Modelling

*« Topic modelling is done by LDA , a model is trained and
the POS tagged input is given, the topic is found and
given as the final output.
